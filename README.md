## Description

A simple Javascript clone of the classic Tetris game developed by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. This game is fully functional but I am working on easier deployment.

## Installation

To play the game clone this repo and run npm run start when entering the directory. That way you'll be ready to play the game on your localhost.
